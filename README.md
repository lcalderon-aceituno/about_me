## Research
### Swarm robotics 
My research seeks to answer a simple question: how can we make it so that the whole is greater than the sum of its parts? 

Swarm robotics seeks to do exactly this by drawing inspiration from nature, were we often see groups of hundreds or thousands of simple individuals, acting together as a collective to acheive complex tasks. Our task is to find the algorithmic and mechanical mechanisms which make this behavior possible, and to try our best to emmulate and utilize it for good.
